# PACP - Polynomial assisted Ad-hoc Charging Protocol

The area of trustworthy charging in self-organized environments has been developed quite recently. This paper introduces a new secure charging-protocol, the polynomial-assisted charging protocol, for these environments. The protocol relies on polynomial composition for speeding the identification process in small groups. This protocol is able to provide strict guarantees of cooperative behaviour in traffic forwarding, with minimal network overhead.

It can be used for identification of routes and charging in ad-hoc, or any other multi-hop scenario.

For more information please check a paper describing it [paper](http://www.joaobarraca.com/page/work/pubs/details/barraca2005.html) or my [dissertation](http://www.joaobarraca.com/page/work/pubs/details/barracaMSc2006.html).

There may exist some deviations from the documents cited as the code evolved. However, the functionality should remain the same.
